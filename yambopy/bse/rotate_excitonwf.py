    """
    Rotate the exciton wavefunction Ak using symmetry operations.

    This function applies a symmetry operation to the exciton wavefunction Ak, 
    which is represented in the basis of electronic states. The rotation is 
    performed using the symmetry matrix in reduced coordinates and the 
    corresponding representation matrices.

    Parameters
    ----------
    Ak : array_like
        Exciton wavefunction coefficients with shape (n_exe_states, nk, nc, nv).
        In case of non-TDA, it is (n_exe_states, 2, nk, nc, nv)
    symm_mat_red : array_like
        Symmetry matrix in reduced coordinates with shape (3, 3).
    kpoints : array_like
        K-points in the full Brillouin zone (crystal coordinates) with shape (nk, 3).
    exe_qpt : array_like
        Momentum of the exciton (q-point) in crystal coordinates with shape (3,).
    dmats : array_like
        Representation matrices for the symmetry operation with shape (nk, Rk_band, k_band).
    time_rev : bool
        If True, apply time-reversal symmetry to the wavefunction.
    ktree : object, optional
        Pre-built k-point tree for efficient k-point searching. If not provided, it will be built.

    Returns
    -------
    rot_Ak : ndarray
        Rotated exciton wavefunction coefficients with the same shape as Ak.
